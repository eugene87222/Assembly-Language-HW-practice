If you want to run assembly code on your computer, I recommand you to install Visual Studio 2010 or higher version on your computer (I use VS 2017 community).  
Also, remember to install irvine library so that you can use many convenient procedures in Irvine32 and Macros library.
There are some tutorials below.
